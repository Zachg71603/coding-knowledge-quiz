# coding-knowledge-quz

The objective of this task was to to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. In this quiz 60 seconds to answer 5 questions and each wrong answer reduces your remaining time by 15 seconds. At the end of the quiz your score is displayed and saved to the highscores presented on the highscores page. This project was a good expirience, as a new developer, and I think the practice will help me for my career.
